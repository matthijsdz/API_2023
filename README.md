AP&amp;I project 2023

Develop a rule-based system to separate choral voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) in choral music recordings.


1. Input Handling: Load and preprocess choral music audio files.
2. Pitch Detection: Identify voice pitches (soprano, alto, tenor, bass).
3. Voice Separation Rules: Develop heuristics to separate voices based on pitch, volume, and spectral characteristics.
4. Voice Harmonization: Create rules for harmonizing voices using music theory principles.
5. Accompaniment Analysis (Optional): Adjust accompanying instruments to complement the vocal arrangement.
6. Output Generation: Combine separated voices and accompaniment to create an enhanced choral arrangement.
7. User Interface (Optional): Design an intuitive interface for users to input and process their choral music.
8. Documentation: Provide clear instructions and examples for users.
9. Testing and Feedback: Evaluate and refine the tool based on user testing and feedback.
10. Deployment: Share the tool with choral musicians and enthusiasts interested in improving choral arrangements
