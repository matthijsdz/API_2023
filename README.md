AP&amp;I project 2023

Develop a rule-based system to separate choral voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) in choral music recordings.

Plan:
1. Input Handling: Load and preprocess choral music audio files.
2. Pitch Detection: Identify voice pitches (soprano, alto, tenor, bass).
3. Voice Separation Rules: Develop heuristics to separate voices based on pitch, volume, and spectral characteristics.
4. User Interface (Optional): Design an intuitive interface for users to input and process their choral music.
5. Testing: Evaluate and refine the tool based on user testing
